```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

Read the dataset:
```{r}
covid <- read.csv("~/Desktop/spring2020/stat207/Covid-19-Bayesian-analysis/data/Covid19-04-13-20.txt")
```

```{r}
# create new variables: proportion of infected per county
covid$density_cases <- covid$Total.cases / covid$Population

# create new variables: rate of death per county
covid$death_rate <- covid$Deaths / covid$Total.cases
```

```{r}
covid
```


Start by describing the variability of the number of cases, $n_i$, especially as they relate to the county's population.

```{r}
# scatter plot of number of infected and population
covid %>% ggplot(aes(x = Population/(10^6), y = Total.cases)) + 
    geom_point() +
    geom_text(data = covid[covid$Population > 5000000,], 
              aes(x = Population/(10^6)-1, y = Total.cases - 250, 
                  label = 'Los Angeles', color = 'red')) +
    theme(legend.position = 'None') +
    xlab('Population (million)') + 
    ggtitle('Distirbution of COVID-19 cases vs. population')
```

```{r}
covid %>% filter(Population < 5000000) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = Population, y = Total.cases)) + geom_point()
```
